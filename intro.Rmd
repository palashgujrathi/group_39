> ### The Dataset

<ul>
<b>
<liThe dataset we are utilizing in this app is comprised of data pertaining to the US state minimum wages from 1968-2017.</li> 
<li>This dataset was taken from kaggle.com, and the data itself came from the US Department of Laborâ€™s website. Within this data set, the values include year, state, values of minimum wages from each of the years mentioned, and the average consumer price index per year. As a disclaimer, we did notice that there were a couple errors in the values of the dataset itself (e.g. Alabama minimum wage was set to $0.00, which is not true), but these errors existed before we plotted the data. 
</ul>
> ### Our Target Audience

<ul>
<li>Our target audience will be working class American citizens, as it is important for them to understand minimum wages and the trends that come along with it.</li>
<li>It is vital to learn about minimum wage because it is a primary factor in helping to create a minimum standard of living in order to protect workers' health and well-being.</li>
<li>The minimum wage also helps to stabilize the economy.</li>
</ul>
