# Project Proposal

>**Project Description:**

The dataset that we will be working with has to do with information regarding Black Friday sales. This data is a sample of transactions made in a retail store. It takes into account the demographics of the consumers (age, gender, stay in the current city, etc.). We accessed this data from kaggle.com, and the data set itself comes from a competition hosted by Analytics Vidhya.
Our target audience will include the retail store’s  business analyst group, the advertising group, and the storekeeper of this particular store location. We want our audience to understand who their target market is based on the demographics of their customers. This way, they are able to market their products appropriately and draw in as much business as possible. The questions our project will answer for our audience will include:
To what degree does a person’s stay in the current city affect the amount of money the consumer spends during Black Friday?
Based on gender, who spends more at this retail store during Black Friday?
What age range spends more money at this retail store during Black Friday?
Does marital status have an impact on how much money a person spends during Black Friday?

>**Technical Description:**

The data we are working on is a .csv file. Therefore we will be using the Rstudio to read the file and convert it into a data frame. Further we will be filtering the data to focus on some certain demographics like age range, gender, martial status, residing in the current city etc. We will be using libraries such as ggplot2, dplyr, purr, tidyr, and knitr. We are trying to answer questions such as spending for given age range, does martial status affect spending amount?, also do people living in the current city tend to spend more than the visitors?, Based on gender, who spends more at this retail store during Black Friday? The major challenges that we anticipate on are filtering the data randomly and plotting it accordingly. Also making interactive visualization with ability to interact with the interface.
